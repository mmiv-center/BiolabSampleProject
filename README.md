# Biolab Sample Project

This project provides a single page application that can load an Excel and a Word document using drag and drop. It perfoms some data sorting and a concentration curve fit. It displays the resulting IC50 values and allows to export the result as a spreadsheet.

In order to use the program you can clone this repository and start a web-server in its root directory (aka php -S localhost:8080).
